# Flight Data Reader

## How to use this project

1. In the dk.cphbusiness.flightdemo.FlightReader class, you will find methods to read flight data from a json file into a list of DTO objects.
2. To see an example of using streams to get info from the collection, look at the dk.cphbusiness.flightdemo.FlightReader.getFlightInfoDetails() method.
3. In the test package, you will find a test class that tests the FlightReader and FlightWriter classes. Build on this to add more functionality to the FlightReader class.
